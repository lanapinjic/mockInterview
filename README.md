# mockInterview  

## Overview  
**mockInterview** is a web platform designed to help users practice mock interviews by recording themselves and receiving AI-powered feedback. The platform allows users to:  
- **Choose a question** from a predefined bank or add their own.  
- **Record their response** directly within the app.  
- **Get AI-driven analysis** on tone, confidence, and clarity (coming soon).  
- **Track progress** over multiple practice sessions.  

The project is currently under active development, and I am working on implementing **video recording and backend functionality** before moving on to **AI integration**.

## Technologies  
- **React (Vite) & Tailwind CSS** – For the frontend UI.  
- **Google OAuth** – For secure authentication.  
- **React Router** – For handling navigation within the app.  
- **Backend (TBD)** – Under development for session storage and AI processing.  
- **AI Integration (Planned)** – To analyze responses and provide improvement feedback.
